START:
        Set port E bit in RCGCGPIO register (mask 0x10) to enable Port E clock
        Wait 4 clock cycles after enabling Port E clock
        Store pin 2 bitmask in R8 (mask 0x04)
        Write mask in R8 to Port E DIR register (clears input pins, sets output pin)
        Write input / output pin mask to Port E DEN register (mask 0x3C)
        Store input pin mask in R10 for comparison
        Store unlock (LED on) value in R6
        Clear all bits in Port E analog mode selector (AMSEL)
        Clear all bits in Port E analog function selector (AFSEL)
        Clear all bits in Port E port control (PCTL) register to enable regular I/O

LOOP:
        Read the value of Port E DATA register into R5
        Mask the bits we want from R5 into R7
        If input pins in R7 equal unlock (LED on) condition in R6:
                Set output pin bit in Port E data
        Else:
                Clear output pin bit in Port E data
        Go to LOOP
